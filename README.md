Developing Gaming, AI, Graph, Data migration, Web Development, etc via Python/Django

# Goals:
- Gaming development
    - Pygame is a cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games. It provides functionalities for handling various aspects of game development, including graphics, sound, user input, and more. Through pygame you can accomplish the following task:
        - Graphics and Display
        - User Input
        - Sprites and Animation
        - Collision Detection
        - Game Loops
        - Event Handling
        - Community and Documentation - for those documentation visit Pygame home page https://www.pygame.org/docs/
        - Cross-Platform Copatibility
        - Extensibility
    
- Web Data Extraction
    - also known as web scraping, is the process of extracting information from websites. This can involve retrieving data from HTML pages, APIs, or other web-based sources. Web scraping is commonly used for various purposes, such as data analysis, research, and content aggregation. Through Web Scrapping we can accomplish the following tasks
        - HTML Parsing
        - HTTP Requests
        - XPath and CSS Selectors
        - Dynamic Content and AJAX
        - APIs 
        - Robots.txt and Terms of Service
        - Data Cleaning and Transformation
        - Rate Limiting and Authorize Crawling
        - Authentication
        - Proxy Rotation
- Programming a management system
    - For this segment we are going to utilize the Python module TKinter. To learn more about this amazing GUI (Grapihcal User Interface) visit the Doc page https://docs.python.org/3/library/tk.html
